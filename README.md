## TODO list (incomprehensive)
- add content
  - decide what content we actually want in this. Just functions? Models?
- make the tests a thing that actually works
  - need to decide on testing style
- decide on a style guide/best practices for variable names, etc.
- setup a github action to do versioning and releasing
- get this thing actually hosted on PyPI/installable with pip
- add a license to it (probably GPL or MIT)
- come up with a name for the package

## Stuff in the venv
